- 👋 Hi, I’m @andac18
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, technology, animation and illustration. I also like to research on tricks, shortcuts and anything that helps you navigate more easily and safely on the Internet.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming and illustration, especially the last one but both in a self-taught way, helping me with videos or articles / books that I find.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with peers and colleagues who can help me improve my programming skills.
